# Interest Profile

## Active Interests

- **Boundaries** — conceptual, social, systemic. How boundaries form, dissolve, and get negotiated.
- **Origin of life** — abiogenesis, prebiotic chemistry, the transition from chemistry to biology.
- **Dimensional reduction** — techniques for compressing high-dimensional data (t-SNE, UMAP, PCA, etc.) and the conceptual implications.
- **Pol.is** — the platform specifically, and the broader design space of scalable deliberation tools.
- **Collective intelligence** — how groups think, decide, and coordinate. Swarm dynamics, wisdom of crowds, participatory governance.

## Connections & Threads

These interests share common threads worth noting:
- Emergence — how complex structure arises from simple rules (life from chemistry, intelligence from individuals, clusters from high-dimensional data)
- Scale transitions — what changes when you zoom in/out (individual→collective, molecule→organism, high-dim→low-dim)
- Governance & coordination — how systems self-organize and make decisions (boundaries, pol.is, collective intelligence)

## Evaluation Criteria

### What Makes Content Interesting

- **New math applied to opinion data** — novel quantitative methods for analyzing collective perspectives
- **Understanding and stabilizing difference** — approaches that preserve and make sense of diversity rather than eliminating it
- **Datasets** — especially those related to collective opinion, deliberation, or coordination
- **Passive/emergent mapping** — approaches that let structure emerge naturally rather than being imposed
- **Technical keywords**: PCA, clustering, UMAP, dimensional reduction, t-SNE, opinion mapping, collective sense-making

### Prefer This, Not That

| Prefer | Rather Than |
|--------|-------------|
| Understanding and stabilizing difference | Consensus-building |
| Passive/emergent mapping | Active facilitation and imposed structures |
| Specific mathematical tools and methods | Nuanced LLM-based approaches to deliberation |

### What's Less Interesting

- Purely theoretical work without datasets or applications

### Output Formats
