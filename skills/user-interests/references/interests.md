# Interest Profile

## Active Interests

- **Boundaries** — conceptual, social, systemic. How boundaries form, dissolve, and get negotiated.
- **Origin of life** — abiogenesis, prebiotic chemistry, the transition from chemistry to biology.
- **Dimensional reduction** — techniques for compressing high-dimensional data (t-SNE, UMAP, PCA, etc.) and the conceptual implications.
- **Pol.is** — the platform specifically, and the broader design space of scalable deliberation tools.
- **Collective intelligence** — how groups think, decide, and coordinate. Swarm dynamics, wisdom of crowds, participatory governance.

## Connections & Threads

These interests share common threads worth noting:
- Emergence — how complex structure arises from simple rules (life from chemistry, intelligence from individuals, clusters from high-dimensional data)
- Scale transitions — what changes when you zoom in/out (individual→collective, molecule→organism, high-dim→low-dim)
- Governance & coordination — how systems self-organize and make decisions (boundaries, pol.is, collective intelligence)
