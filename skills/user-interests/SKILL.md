# User Interests

Before evaluating content against the user's tastes, read `references/interests.md` for the current interest profile.

Use this to:
- Judge whether an article, paper, project, or link would appeal to the user
- Prioritize or rank content by relevance to their interests
- Explain *why* something might interest them (connect it to a specific interest)

Do not treat interests as rigid filters — look for unexpected connections between topics and the user's interests. The best recommendations often bridge two interests or surface something adjacent.

Update `references/interests.md` when the user adds, removes, or refines their interests.
